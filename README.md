# blockchain-typescript

This is a simple blockchain implementation that supports transactions between two wallets, mining, and more. This is built in typescript and uses an object-oriented paradigm to model the block chain. 
* Still a work in progress (currently the wallet balance system needs to be completed)
* I plan to add more features as I learn more about blockchain
